# launchpad-maxi
A bitwig controller script for the novation launchpad family

Based on [this script](https://www.bitwig.com/en/community/control_scripts/novation/launchpad/launchpad_2.html) with the following additions:

* The launcher now has an edit mode where one can create empty clips of variable length and cut and paste them around
* In edit mode vol, pan send etc can be set with 8 times the precision of the normal mode, but only one at a time
* A new drum pad layout
